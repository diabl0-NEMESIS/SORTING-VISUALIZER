SORTING-VISUALIZER is an application made using UNITY and using C# as the programming language.

the basic idea behind this visualizer is to see how the different sorting techniques like INSERTION,BUBBLE AND SELECTION SORT are implemented.


----------------------IMPORTANT-------------------------------
to run the visualizer open "index.html"

if after running index.html your browser is giving an error message like 
"browser does not support running Unity WebGL content from file:// urls"

then follow these steps on firefox : 
1. open a new tab and enter ->    about:config
2. after you do step 1 enter ->    privacy.file_unique_origin
   and change the predefined value to false.
3. now run index.html again using firefox and it should run without      
    giving error message.
